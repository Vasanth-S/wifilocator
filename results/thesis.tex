\chapter{Abstract}

The development of stable outdoor positioning and tracking algorithms has 
ushered in a new era of technology. Today GPS based navigators are 
ubiquitous and GPS based positioning and navigation has been integrated 
into smartphones. This has made life easy for navigation over large 
distances in an outdoor scenario. A new horizon for research has developed which
aims at providing that same ease of use in navigation 
and tracking in an indoor context.

Over the last few years, advances in technology have allowed for the 
development and integration of MEMS sensors into smartphones. These sensors 
(an accelerometer, a gyroscope and a magnetometer) can be leveraged to 
develop an indoor tracking solution. However, the resource constrained nature 
of smartphones necessitates modifications to prior work achieving the same 
in a non-mobile context. Additionally, the fact that 
the tracking device lies in a user's palm and not on a protected, stable 
surface (as is the case in robotics) generates a new set of challenges.

This thesis proposes and implements an online particle filter based algorithm for 
indoor positioning on an Android smartphone for pedestrians. The proposed algorithm 
is not only able to work well on the resource constrained device, it actually
yields an accuracy better than prior work in this area. Such results have 
been made possible by a careful approach to the problem with decisions made 
on factual data determined before and during the implementation of the 
proposed work. The final system is able to achieve a mean error of $0.5 m$
with a very low standard deviation value of $0.24 m$ and provides a clean,
intuitive tracked path. Results for comparison are produced using
a simple dead reckoning approach and a Nearest Neighbour 
Wifi corrected tracking algorithm. Both the algorithms are tested in the same
environment as the proposed work.
