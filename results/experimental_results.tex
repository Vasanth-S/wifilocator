(retry, retry with greater inaccuracy)

\section{Particle filter + Wifi data}
TODO

\subsection{Case 1: Use of Wifi data for accounting for drift errors}
\subsection{Case 2: Use of Oriented Wifi data for accounting for drift errors}
\subsection{Case 3: Use of clamped wifi data for accounting for drift errors}
\subsection{Case 4: Use of area Restricted Wifi data for accounting for drift errors}

\section{Signal Strength Map}

TODO if time permits
Wifi signal strength map developed using crowdsourced data for use in systems such as RedPin.

\section{Issues faced}
Incorrect step sizes yielded states in which no further progress was possible using data from the inertial sensors. Hence we had to resort to wifi data to get out of the blind spot.

Limited processing power and near-realtime time constraints of operation constrain computational 
complexity of the solution.

Surveying is the biggest issue in this system.
