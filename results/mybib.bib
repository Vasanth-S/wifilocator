This paper presents the design, implementation and analysis of a positioning system called COMPASS which is based on 802.11-compliant network infrastructure and digital compasses. On the mobile device, COMPASS samples the signal strength values of different access points in its communication range and utilizes the orientation of the user to preselect a subset of the training data. The remaining training data is used by a probabilistic positioning algorithm to determine the position of the user. While prior systems show limited accuracy due to blocking effects caused by the human body, we apply digital compasses to detect the orientations of the users so that we can deal with these blocking effects. After a short period of training our COMPASS system achieves an average error distance of less than 1.65 meters in our experimental environment of 312 square meters.}",

Three typical location estimation schemes of triangulation, scene analysis, and proximity are analyzed. We also discuss location fingerprinting in detail since it is used in most current system or solutions. We then examine a set of properties by which location systems are evaluated, and apply this evaluation method to survey a number of existing systems. Comprehensive performance comparisons including accuracy, precision, complexity, scalability, robustness, and cost are presented.}",

@mastersthesis{Anthea,
    abstract = "{As the demand of indoor Location-Based Services (LBSs) increases, there is a grow-
ing interest in developing an accurate indoor positioning and tracking system on mobile
devices. The core location determination problem can be reformulated as a sparse na-
tured problem and thus can be solved by applying the Compressive Sensing (CS) theory.
This thesis proposes a compact received signal strength (RSS) based real-time indoor
positioning and tracking systems using CS theory that can be implemented on personal
digital assistants (PDAs) and smartphones, which are both limited in processing power
and memory compared to laptops. The proposed tracking system, together with a simple
navigation module is implemented on Windows Mobile-operated smart devices and their
performance in different experimental sites are evaluated. Experimental results show
that the proposed system is a lightweight real-time algorithm that performs better than
other traditional fingerprinting methods in terms of accuracy under constraints of limited
processing and memory resources.}",
