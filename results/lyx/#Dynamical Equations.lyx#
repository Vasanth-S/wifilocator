For the case where the coordinate system for the map is 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 positive towards right and 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 positive downwards with 
\begin_inset Formula $TrueNorth$
\end_inset

 of the map pointing upwards.

\begin_layout Standard
This dynamical representation is overtly simplistic because it doesn't take
 into account real world issues as seen in the groundwork section.
 The most important issue is the issue of sensor drift.
 The magnetometer is a rather inaccurate sensor and is rated to an accuracy
 of 5 degrees in static circumstances.
 There is also a recommendation to re-calibrate before use.
 This is required because this sensor suffers from a lot of sensor noise
 and drift.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Recalibration of the magnetometer involves moving it around in a pattern
 of 8.
 Effectively, that randomizes internal magnetic elements enough for magnetic
 saturation effects to be neutralized.
 Unfortunately, for a continuous use scenario like ours, recalibration of
 this sensor is not an option.
 Hence, we modify our dynamical equation to take this error into account.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this dynamical equation, we have added an additional parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{mag}$
\end_inset

which is a random variable that represents random white noise in the reading
 from the true value of the magnetometer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Besides the sensor noise that creeps into the values of the magnetometer,
 there are 2 other issues that need to be taken care of in our dynamical
 modelling of the dead reckoning system.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first issue is an issue of bias in the angle readings from the magnetometer.
 This bias can creep in due to 2 different reasons - the first being specific,
 environmental magnetic fields which distort the actual detection of 
\begin_inset Formula $TrueNorth$
\end_inset

 in the system and the second being a bias that creeps in due to the way
 the user holds the smartphone in the palm of his hand and the offset thus
 produced.
 To take into account such offsets, we modify the dynamical equations as
 follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $\begin{bmatrix}x_{i+1}\\
y_{i+1}
\end{bmatrix}$
\end_inset

= 
\begin_inset Formula $\begin{bmatrix}x_{i}\\
y_{i}
\end{bmatrix}$
\end_inset

 + 
\begin_inset Formula $d{}_{i}$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $\begin{bmatrix}-cos(\theta_{i}+\theta_{b}+\vartheta+\phi_{mag})\\
sin(\theta_{i}+\theta_{b}+\phi_{mag})
\end{bmatrix}$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this modified version of the dynamical equations, we have added a slowly
 varying term 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{b}$
\end_inset

that represents an explicit bias in the readings from the magnetometer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second issue at hand is step size variation and the issue of missing
 or extra step detection.
 To map accelerometer readings to step sizes, we have used the empirical
 equation provided by [ref].
 However, this empirical equation doesn't take into account changes in step
 sizes due to changes in footwear or floor material.
 To account for this bias in step size detection, we introduce an additional
 parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{b}$
\end_inset

in the dynamical system.
 The new equations for the dynamical system are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $\begin{bmatrix}x_{i+1}\\
y_{i+1}
\end{bmatrix}$
\end_inset

= 
\begin_inset Formula $\begin{bmatrix}x_{i}\\
y_{i}
\end{bmatrix}$
\end_inset

 + 
\begin_inset Formula $(d{}_{i}+d_{b})$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $\begin{bmatrix}-cos(\theta_{i}+\theta_{b}+\phi_{mag})\\
sin(\theta_{i}+\theta_{b}+\phi_{mag})
\end{bmatrix}$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this representation, 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{b}$
\end_inset

is a slowly varying bias variable on the step size.
