\chapter{Summary and Future Work\label{chap:summary}}
Use and evaluation of SVM as a suitable architecture for the Wifi data.
Better integration of information from the camera.
Integration of information using a Barometric sensor would be useful for detecting elevation changes. A system for the same is proposed but the experimental results were not obtained. 


\section{Particle filter + Wifi data}

\subsection{Case 1: Use of Wifi data for accounting for drift errors}
\subsection{Case 2: Use of Oriented Wifi data for accounting for drift errors}
\subsection{Case 3: Use of clamped wifi data for accounting for drift errors}
\subsection{Case 4: Use of area Restricted Wifi data for accounting for drift errors}
\subsection{Case 7: Simple post processing of output.??}

\section{Signal Strength Map}

TODO if time permits
Wifi signal strength map developed using crowdsourced data for use in systems such as RedPin.
