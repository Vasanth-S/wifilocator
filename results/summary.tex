\chapter{Summary and Future Work}
Use and evaluation of SVM as a suitable architecture for the Wifi data.
Better integration of information from the camera.
Integration of information using a Barometric sensor would be useful for detecting elevation changes. A system for the same is proposed but the experimental results were not obtained.
