Introduction

\begin_layout Standard
Indoor positioning has been a topic of active research for the past decade
 with the first research system using RF signals for distance estimation
 and indoor positioning being produced by Microsoft Research (RADAR, 2000).
 Of course, systems like Active Badge have been developed as far back as
 1992 to locate targets indoors but they have shown limited utility on account
 of the requirement to deploy specialized sensors for detecting the radio
 tags deployed within the system.
 Since RADAR, a number of improvements have been made in the core algorithms
 and technologies for positioning.
 Over time, indoor positioning has progressed from simply using RF signals
 to using ubiquitous 802.11 Access Points as radio sources.
 With the development of UWB (Ultra Wide Band) technology, very fine grained
 ranging and tracking results have been obtained over target distances of
 the order of a few hundred feet from the radio source.
 However, the primary scale of interest for commercial exploitation of indoor
 positioning and tracking is of the order of the size of warehouses and
 malls (~2500 m2 or more) with an accuracy that is preferably of the order
 of a few meters.
 The target applications for such a scenario are inventory location and
 tracking; location based services and personalized offers from businesses
 based on physical proximity to their shops or other points of sale.
 The ultimate target to be achieved in this line of research is: Create
 a low complexity, low cost indoor positioning system that is maintainable,
 reasonably accurate and highly scalable.
 UWB, unfortunately, does not scale easily to such large spaces without
 requiring that a significant number of sensors and repeaters be installed
 in the target positioning area specifically for this purpose.
 It is also an expensive technology.
 On the other hand, IEEE 802.11 AP based positioning has low complexity and
 cost and it has a large installed base, thus making it attractive for positioni
ng purposes as a source of radio signals.
 Thus it is interesting to explore the limitations of accuracy, scalability
 and maintainability of indoor positioning systems that are based on IEEE
 802.11 Access Points.
